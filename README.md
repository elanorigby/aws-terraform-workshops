### This repository contains terraform configuration for Smartling AWS/Terraform workshops covered in blog posts at [https://tech.smartling.com](https://tech.smartling.com)
 
# W1 Notes
Make sure not to check your AWS Keys into git.

Also, don't use your root user keys. Go through the (relatively minimal) faff of making an Administrator IAM account and use those. Hopefully later when we do the IAM workshop we'll set up a more restrictice user to use.
